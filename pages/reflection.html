                        <h3>Our Experience</h3>

                        <p>The transition to learning code has had a varied steepness, since some in our group has coded
                            before while it
                            is completely new to others. Regarding programming, those of us that had previous
                            programming experience
                            come with knowledge in Java, Python, or Javascript.</p>

                        <p>In the programming course, many students have encountered an issue with the JavaFX section.
                            In reality, the
                            JavaFX package is already obsolete, but for some reason we have to find a way to make it
                            work on the most
                            recent Java version. It could even come up on the examination, which is shocking. Then
                            again, what can us
                            students do but to obey the laws laid down by the king of programming. In reality, though,
                            who uses JavaFX
                            today professionally? This is very perplexing.</p>

                        <p>Some that are struggling with programming have difficulty with constructing the logic behind
                            the code. This
                            comes with practice. Code made by two different persons can look very different. In regards
                            to our
                            assignments, we are somewhat bound to following the rules of the text, but it would be
                            interesting if we
                            would try a more open challenge with less boundaries. When following the assignment text, we
                            may argue about
                            small details, despite the code working very similarly.</p>

                        <p>So far, we have gotten an introduction to Java. Yet, there are still a multitude of other
                            vastly used
                            programming languages like SQL, Python, C#, C++, and Javascript, of course. Then there are
                            different fields
                            of programming, such as app development (ex. Android, iOS), game development, web
                            development, system
                            development, and many more. In app dev, there are even more topics to cover, such as
                            multiplatform
                            development, and which program to use for the actual development and testing. This is yet
                            only grasping the
                            surface, as there are more advanced fields such as cloud development, server development,
                            server and web
                            security, artificial intelligence, financial programming, and business analysis.</p>

                        <h4>The Girl Without A Dragon Tattoo</h4>

                        <p>Code is completely new to me, so I find it fairly difficult. I have yet to fully grasp the
                            concepts and translating my ideas into code. I will have to practice a lot. In the future, I
                            would like to learn advanced logarithms and coding that can benefit scientific research.</p>

                        <h4>James Bond Fan</h4>

                        <p>I programmed a bit last year in Java, Python, etc. so it hasn't been too hard yet. I'm
                            looking forward to learning more and improving my understanding and knowledge. I'm curious
                            about many topics - like artificial intelligence, web security, app dev, game dev, and more,
                            but unless you are a genius, you got to focus on one thing (at the time).</p>

                        <p>Seriously, though, I'm guessing that the person's name is Peter / Patricia.</p>

                        <h4>A Troubled Garlic Farmeress</h4>

                        <p>I have some previous experience with web development, but programming is still quite
                            challenging. On the positive side, I managed to do all the required assignments, and am
                            proud of that. I like to make websites and hope to do this professionally one day.</p>

                        <h4>||**UnknownProGamer**||</h4>

                        <p>I'm familiar with C++ so it was a smooth transition to coding in Java. I would like some more
                            challenge to test my skillz, bro. I'm not talking about <abbr
                                title="League of Legends">LoL</abbr>. My dream is to become an ethical hacker and fight
                            cyber crime - just like in the movies.</p>
