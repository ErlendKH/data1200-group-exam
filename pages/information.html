                            The problem however is that it is almost impossible

                        <p>Deep fakes can also be used to bring historical figures back to life, or make animals talk.
                            This can be great in education for young kids. Moreover a deepfake
                            can make "fake teachers", that uses AI to teach the kids.

                        <h3>The dangerous uses of deepfakes</h3>

                        <p>Unfortunately deepfakes can make it appear that a person has said something he or she hasn't.
                            It can both manipulate the body language and voice.

                            of them are real!

                        <p>Not only are politicians misused to spread fake news. There are thousands of deepfakes of
                            celebrities in porn videos. They become easier and easier to make
                            and harder and harder to spot. This is conserning, and can not be fun to the people
                            exploited in the videos.
                            Tracy Clark-Flory, a senior staff writer at Jezebel, talks more about it in this

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                        <p>Deepfakes can be an amazing tool in the right setting, and we are yet to explore all the
                            potenital uses. It is however important that it is not missused.
                            It is important that everyone is informed about the potential missues, so that they can be
                            more critical on what they read on the internet.
